<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Third project developed for Driven Software Engineer bootcamp, you can check it out by this <a href="https://driven-eats-pi.vercel.app/">link</a>. The first module of the course was an introduction to Interfaces and Front-end Aplications, so we explored interactive interfaces built by HTML, CSS and Javascript, so to consolidate knowledge the project task was to create a mobile interface of a food delivery application, so it might be accessed just by mobile viewports, it's not designed for desktop devices.
